##Echo.js
Version  0.0.5

Echo.js is a 2D canvas framing and animation library. 

####But those already exist, why are you re-inventing the wheel?
My kid daughter, Echo, is getting to the age where she can start learning  programming, but keeping her interest is difficult. She likes games, so we built a simple game using [Phaser.js](https://phaser.io/) but I ended up doing a lot of it because Phaser is just too advanced for a kid her age. So I decided to build a super simple set of tools even a kid can use to create fun animations and watch their code come to life.

####Cool! How do I use it?
You don't. It's not usable yet. When I'm done I'll put documentation in the Wiki, and maybe kid-friendly lessons.

####But I'm nosey and I'm gonna poke at your code anyway and you can't stop me!
Fine, butthead! My code is impeccably documented and there are demos and tests in the `/demos` directory.
